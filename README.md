<details>
   <summary id="kubernetes">
       ‚ò∏ Kubernetes
   </summary>
  The Kubernetes deployment configuration outlines the deployment details for the microservices within the application ecosystem. With a starting replica count of 2, Kubernetes ensures high availability by maintaining two instances of the microservice to handle incoming requests. Pods are selected based on the specified label, ensuring consistency in pod selection and management across the cluster. Each pod is based on a Docker image, configured to expose its own port for incoming traffic. The deployment incorporates a readiness probe, configured to check the "/actuator/health" endpoint of the Spring Boot application (That endpoint is predefined if the app uses spring boot actuator). This probe ensures that the deployed service is fully initialized and ready to accept requests before being added to the load balancer rotation. With an initial delay of 30 seconds and subsequent checks every 10 seconds, Kubernetes waits for the service to become ready before directing traffic to it. This approach prevents premature routing of requests to the service, guaranteeing a seamless user experience once the service is fully operational. Additionally, the deployment specifies resource requests and limits to manage the memory and CPU utilization of the deployed pods effectively. Resource requests are set to 128Mi of memory and 250m of CPU, while resource limits are set to 512Mi of memory and 750m of CPU. By defining these resource constraints, Kubernetes ensures efficient resource utilization and prevents resource contention among pods within the cluster.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="auto-scalar">
       üìà Auto Scalar
   </summary>
 Before configuring the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for our microservices within the application ecosystem, we ensured the Kubernetes Metrics Server was enabled to gather resource utilization metrics across the cluster. With this prerequisite in place, The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration outlines the scaling behavior for a microservice within the application ecosystem. With a scale target reference to the corresponding Deployment, the HPA ensures dynamic scaling based on resource utilization metrics. The HPA is configured to scale up or down ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è based on average CPU utilization, targeting a utilization threshold of 80% and scaling up to 5 parallel pod in total (limited to only 5 due to the host machine capabilites and RAM). When resource utilization exceeds this threshold, the HPA initiates scaling actions ‚¨ÜÔ∏è to increase the number of replicas, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization. To prevent excessive scaling, the HPA incorporates scaling policies with stabilization windows for both scaling up and scaling down. These policies aim to stabilize the system before initiating scaling actions, avoiding rapid fluctuations in replica counts and ensuring stability under varying workload conditions. Overall, this HPA configuration enables adaptive scaling of microservices based on resource utilization, enhancing efficiency and performance within the Kubernetes cluster.

<details>
   <summary id="service-discovery">
       üîé Service Discovery
   </summary>
  In Kubernetes, service discovery is a crucial aspect of managing distributed applications. Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery mechanisms that allow applications to locate and communicate with each other dynamically. This is achieved through Kubernetes Services, which act as an abstraction layer to provide a stable endpoint for accessing pods that belong to a specific application. By using labels and selectors, Kubernetes Services automatically discover and route traffic to the appropriate pods, regardless of their underlying infrastructure or location within the cluster. This enables seamless communication between microservices and facilitates the scalability and resilience of distributed applications in Kubernetes environments.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="load-balancer">
       ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer
   </summary>
  In Kubernetes, the built-in Load Balancer functionality is facilitated through the Kubernetes Service object. This component plays a pivotal role in distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of an application or service deployed within a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes Service abstracts away the complexities of load balancing by providing a stable endpoint, known as a ClusterIP, for accessing pods associated with a specific application or service. By leveraging labels and selectors defined in the Service configuration, Kubernetes dynamically routes incoming traffic to the appropriate pods, ensuring efficient load distribution and high availability. The routing algorithm used by the built-in Kubernetes Load Balancer is typically round-robin, which evenly distributes incoming requests among the available pods. This approach ensures that each pod receives a fair share of the incoming traffic, preventing overloading of any single pod and promoting scalability and resilience within the cluster.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="web-server">
       üåê Web Server
   </summary>
  The Kubernetes Ingress configuration defines the routing rules for incoming HTTP traffic to the NGINX web server within the Kubernetes cluster. Using the Ingress resource, we exposed HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster, enabling external access to applications and microservices. In this configuration, the Ingress resource specifies routing rules based on the requested host and URL path. Annotations are used to configure additional behavior, such as rewriting URL paths. The Ingress resource abstracts away the complexities of managing external access to services and provides a centralized configuration for routing HTTP traffic within the Kubernetes cluster.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="continous-integration">
       üîÅ Continous Integration
   </summary>
  This project implements Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions, automating the build and deployment process for individual microservices like the Freelancer microservice. Triggered by code pushes to the "master" branch or pull requests targeting the same branch, the CI pipeline executes a tailored series of steps for each microservice. These steps include code checkout, Maven-based compilation (cleaning and packaging the app into .jar file), Docker image creation, and push to Docker Hub. By seamlessly integrating CI into the development workflow and utilizing triggers configured to activate only when modifications occur within the respective microservice directories, this approach ensures rapid feedback loops, enhanced code quality, and efficient delivery of updates to individual microservices while optimizing resource utilization and reducing unnecessary overhead.
</details>

### üìä Logging & Monitoring

<details>
   <summary id="slf4j">
       üìö SLF4J
   </summary>
  We implemented logging functionality using the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) framework, a widely adopted logging abstraction layer. This allows us to decouple the logging implementation from the application code, providing flexibility to switch between different logging frameworks such as Logback, Log4j, or Java Util Logging (JUL) without modifying the codebase. Our logging aspect, represented by the AppLogger class, utilizes SLF4J's logger interface to record method invocations, arguments, return values, exectution time, and exceptions. By leveraging SLF4J, we ensure consistent and standardized logging across our microservices, facilitating troubleshooting, monitoring, and performance analysis.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="prometheus">
       üõ¢ Prometheus
   </summary>
  In our Kubernetes environment, we've integrated Prometheus for comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection across all services deployed within the cluster. Prometheus is configured to scrape Kubernetes metrics server data as well as Spring Boot Actuator endpoints exposed by each service. Leveraging Kubernetes service discovery, Prometheus dynamically discovers and scrapes relevant endpoints, ensuring seamless integration with new services as they are deployed. Annotations are utilized to specify scraping configurations for each service (/actuator/prometheus). This setup enables us to gather rich insights into the performance, health, and behavior of our microservices, empowering proactive monitoring, alerting, and analysis to maintain system reliability and scalability.
</details>

<details>
   <summary id="grafana">
       üì∂ Grafana
   </summary>
  Within our Kubernetes cluster, we've deployed Grafana as a powerful visualization and monitoring tool to complement Prometheus. Grafana is configured to connect to Prometheus as a data source using the Prometheus server's cluster IP address and the exposed container port. This integration enables Grafana to query and visualize the rich metrics collected by Prometheus, providing insights into the health, performance, and behavior of our microservices. Leveraging Grafana's intuitive dashboarding capabilities, we've created custom dashboards tailored to monitor Kubernetes-specific metrics as well as application-level metrics exposed by Prometheus. This setup empowers our team with real-time visibility into the state of our Kubernetes environment and the performance of our microservices, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive monitoring.
